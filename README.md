# HBDT

The ‘Telecommunications & Remote Sensing Laboratory’ (TLCLab) of the University of Pavia, together with other four Universities partners, participated in the project named ‘Very high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing: a novel integrated data analysis system’, funded by the ‘Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca’ (MIUR). 
One of the main output produced by the TLCLab has seen the development of a software tool named  ‘Hierarchical Binary Decision Tree’ (HBDT), which is able to classify space-borne remote sensing images. 

In this repository is available the QGIS plugin of the HBDT.

To install and use it:
- 1.	Locate the plug-in folder of QGIS:
    - UNIX: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins
    - Windows: ~/.qgis2/python/plugins 
    - Note: In Windows the path is usually something like: C: /Documents and Settings/ (user) /.qgis2/python/plugins.  
- 2.	Create a new folder and name it as “HBDTree”;
- 3.	Copy all the files available here in the ‘HBDTree’ folder;
    - Note: it will look like: ~/python/plugins/ HBDTree /'files'
- 4.	Open QGIS and enable the HBDTree plugin under Plug-ins/Manage Plug-ins....
