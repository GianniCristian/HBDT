# HBDT

The ‘Telecommunications & Remote Sensing Laboratory’ (TLCLab) of the University of Pavia, together with other four Universities partners, participated in the project named ‘Very high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing: a novel integrated data analysis system’, funded by the ‘Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca’ (MIUR). 
One of the main output produced by the TLCLab has seen the development of a software tool named  ‘Hierarchical Binary Decision Tree’ (HBDT), which is able to classify space-borne remote sensing images. 

In this repository is available the QGIS plugin of the HBDT.
